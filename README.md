# graphql

My GraphQL project for 01 founders.

# Objectives

The objective of this project is to learn the query language graphQL by creating your own profile page. It will be provided,
by the platform, a graphQL endpoint that is connected to the database. So you can query this endpoint to obtain the information you desire.
Note that for security reasons some tables are private and some are public, you will only be provided with certain content.

Your profile must have at least 3 sections of content at your choice, for example:

    Basic user identification
    XP amount
    level
    grades
    audits
    skills

Beside those sections it will have a mandatory section for the generation of statistic graphs.

# Instructions

You will have to create a profile UI where you can see your own school information. This information/data is present on the graphQL endpoint, where you will have to query it.

The UI design is up to you. However, have in mind the principles of a good UI.
The UI will have a statistic section where you can generate graphs to see more about your journey and achievements on the school. This graphs must be done using SVG. You will have to do at least two different statistic graphs for the data given.

Using SVG you can create several types of graphs including interactive graphs and animated graph. It will be up to you to decide what type of graphs you are going to do.

Here are some possible combinations for the creation of the graphs:

    XP earned in a time period (progress over time)
    Levels over time
    XP earned by project
    Audit ratio
    Projects PASS and FAIL ratio
    Piscine (JS/Go) stats
        PASS and FAIL ratio
        Attempts for each exercise

Any other information you desire to display is welcome and will be noted.
