# graphql

My GraphQL project for 01 founders.

Objectives

The objective of this project is to learn the query language graphQL by creating your own profile page. It will be provided,
by the platform, a graphQL endpoint that is connected to the database. So you can query this endpoint to obtain the information you desire.
Note that for security reasons some tables are private and some are public, you will only be provided with certain content.

Your profile must have at least 3 sections of content at your choice, for example:

    Basic user identification
    XP amount
    level
    grades
    audits
    skills

Beside those sections it will have a mandatory section for the generation of statistic graphs.
